In order to run, I used a virtual environment (venv.) However due to the extreme size of the upload, is not really necessary.

The requirements are already displayed in the requirements.txt file. There, you will be able to download and run all specific versions.

Make sure Flask is downloaded.

In order to run the code itself, simply type:

python3 app.py
