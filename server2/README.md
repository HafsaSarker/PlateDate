In order to run, I used a virtual environment (venv.) However due to the extreme size of the upload, is not really necessary.

The requirements are already displayed in the requirements.txt file. There, you will be able to download and run all specific versions.

Keep in mind that bson is from pymongo itself.

python3 -m venv venv

Requirements: pip install Flask==3.0.2 pymongo==4.6.2 certifi==2023.11.17 pandas==2.1.4 numpy==1.26.3 scikit-learn==1.3.2 python-dotenv

Runs app: python3 app.py
